copy the src folder to the /usr/src folder of the minix system.
after the copy there should be a compile_work.sh script on 
/usr/src, run this script and it will compile all the minix system
and install a new minix image. Just reboot the system and choose
the custom boot option (option 2).

This code works only on minix 3.14 out of the box since it
makes use of code that belongs to minix 3.14, overwriting it
on a moded minix or a diferent version may have unexpected
behaviour.
