TODO list for ChunkBake.

MAJOR FEATURES TODO

* listing mode (generation of assembler LST-style files)
  - low priority: ChunkSpy can do this quite well for now
* assembler syntax: macros
* assembler syntax: conditionals
* assembler syntax: include files
* stripped binary chunk mode (don't write debug information)
* assembler source generation mode for ChunkSpy
* intrinsic functions and constants in expressions
* search local symbol tables to auto-detect valid upvalues

OTHER STUFF TODO

* initialize labels before related statement is processed, as the
  operands in the statements may refer to the said labels
* TAILCALL might be allowed as a last instruction, need to check lvm.c
* check what Lua reports when an error occurs, see if the error
  message can be properly traced back to the assembly source
* complete more examples of assembly code
* review tests and refine behaviour of ChunkBake
* improve error messages by handling stuff after all of a statement is
  parsed, don't start setting stuff during parsing
* how to set a local's scope? an assembler should be able to control
  the startpc and endpc fields of a local specification
* should labels tag directives if they are on separate lines? right
  now labels must be tied to a statement

WARNING NOTIFICATIONS TODO

These should be made optional:
* warn of unused items like unused parameters, upvalues, etc.
* warn of named local colliding with use of numbered registers
* verify existence of upvalues, perhaps simplify declaration of upvalues
