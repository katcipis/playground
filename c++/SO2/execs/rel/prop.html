<title>Implementing security on EPOS</title>
</head><body>

<p>
The main ideia of this project is to develop an encryption mecanism in EPOS, allowing to encrypt data that is on the memory. We are going to use the IDEA algorithm. It chosen because it's small, easy to implement and easy to use. The idea is not to learn how to implement such algorithm, but to learn how to develop an encryption mecanism in an operation system to maintain data that is on the memory safe, on an eficient/modular way (using SMP).

Besides we didnt tested it yet we found an description of the IDEA algorithm, together with a minimal implementation that we intent on using:

<p> 
In case there is some problem using IDEA we also found an simple DES implementation:
