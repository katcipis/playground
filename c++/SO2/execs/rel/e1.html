<p></p><h1>E1: Idle-waiting Thread Joining</h1><p></p>
<strong>Problem:</strong>
              
    <p>The initial version of EPOS-- you are currently working with implements thread joining with a simple trick:</p>
                  
    <table width="100%" border="0">

      <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td width="1%" align="right"><font color="#cc0000"><code lang="c">
		1.<br>
		2.<br>
		3.<br>
		4.<br>

		5.
	      </code></font></td>
	  <td><code lang="c">
	      int Thread::join() {<br>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; while(_state != FINISHING)<br>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield();<br>

	      &nbsp; &nbsp; return *((int *)_stack);<br>
	      }
	    </code></td>
	</tr>
      </tbody> 
    </table>
          
    <p>That is, testing the state of the thread being waited for until
    it turns to <samp>FINISHING</samp> (line 2). To give other threads a
    chance to run, and thus terminate, the calling thread invokes
    <samp>yield</samp> after each test.</p>

       
    <p>You are requested to modify the implementation of
    <samp>Thread</samp> so that <samp>join()</samp> no longer wastes
    time sampling the waited thread status. It must be set to sleep
    until the waited-for thread terminates, and then waken up
    accordingly.</p>
    

    
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

    <p> Consists on a Queue of joined threads on each Thread instance, everytime a thread call the <samp>join()</samp> method 
        the caller thread is suspended and put on the Queue of joined threads of the callee thread. 
        When the callee thread exits it will resume all the threads that are suspended on the joined threads Queue. 
        This way CPU will not be wasted, since the caller threads will stay suspended until que the callee thread exits. </p>

    <p> The changes where made on the <samp> join() </samp> and <samp> exit() </samp> methods. 
        Here is the source code implementing the changes and the source code to test it. </p>
