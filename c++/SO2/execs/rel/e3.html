<h1>E3: system object destruction</h1>

<b> problem </b>

<p>
EPOS abstracts system entities as ordinary C++ objects, thus promoting usability. At some points, however, the semantics of operating system and programming language do not seem to fit together easily. Consider for instance the case in which a system abstraction (say thread), created by the application programmer with new, is destroyed by the operating system (e.g. exit). Or the counterpart situation: the application programmer deleting a thread that is currently being manipulated by the operating system

A careful binding between programming language and operating system must be defined to prevent undesirable side effects.</p>

<b>Solution:</b>

<p>
On Thread destructor it was necessary to verify if the Thread was sleeping, and in case it was sleeping remove it from the Queue it was sleeping.
We also resumed all the Threads that joined the Thread, if we dont do this all the joining Threads may wait forever. 
It was also added on a _exit_status holding the status of the exit when the Thread finishes normaly, and
when a Thread joins another it is used on the caller Thread to hold the exit status of the callee Thread, when the callee is deleted we dont have a stack to
hold the exit status code, so joining a Thread that has been deleted would take garbage as status. In this case the exit status is stored
on the Thread that called join(), preventing the status from being lost (-1 is returned signalizing an error when the thread is deleted before exiting).

<p> 
The sleep and wakeup methods also become static, and they receive the Queue where the Thread is going to be inserted to sleep.
A lock is also passed to the sleep method to guarantee that the Syncronizer_Commom lock is released only when the Thread is
inserted on the sleeping Queue, but before setting the Thread to sleep. This guarantee atomicity on the Syncronizer calls (see Mutex and Semaphore implementation).

The Queue is manipulated only inside the Thread class after we guarantee that only one Thread will be editing the _sleeping Queue. The old implementation used
to edit the Queue outside (on Syncronizer_Commom), but this could cause a race condition between a call to sleep() / wakeup() and the destruction of a Thread.

The Syncronizer_Commom implementation is pretty straightforward.

<p> To test object destruction we used a simple test:</p>

<p> 
The semaphore had a inconsistency when a Thread that was sleeping on the Semaphore was deleted. 
We could have a Semaphore with a _value that does not reflect the amount of Thread that are
sleeping on the Semaphore. Because of that we could have a situation where a Thread that calls
p() is put to sleep (because of _value) but there is no one to wakeup the Thread. To fix that
we always check if there is any Thread to be waked before calling wakeup.. if there is no one we found
the inconsistency (a Thread has been deleted). So we reset _value to 1.
