<p></p><h1>E2: Idle-waiting Thread Synchronization</h1><p></p>
<strong>Problem:</strong>
              
                  
    <p>Similarly to the <samp><a href="join.html">join</a></samp>
    method, the initial version of EPOS-- you are currently working with
    implements thread synchronization with a simple trick:</p>

    <p>That is, synchronization abstractions such as
    <samp>Semaphore</samp> and <samp>Mutex</samp> continuously test for
    changes on a control variable, invoking <samp>yield</samp> after
    each test (line 2). This trick allows for empty implementations of
    <samp>wakeup</samp> and <samp>wakeup_all</samp>, but bears little
    predictability and performance.</p>


    <strong>Solution:</strong>

    <p> Consists on creating an _sleeping Queue on the Synchronizer_Common class.
        Everytime a call to sleep() is made the thread that called sleep() is 
        inserted on the _sleeping Queue and is suspended (or locked). 
        When someone calls wakeup(), a Thread is removed from the Queue
        and set to resume (or unlocked). We also used a SpinLock to guarantee
        that while a Thread is inside the sleep() call if it looses the CPU
        another Thread will not be able to enter sleep() or wakeup() until the
        last Thread finishes its call. A SpinLock is used because we dont want to
        mess with the scheduler inside the Synchronizer implementation, so we
        cant disable interruptions. </p>

    <p> We also implemented the busy_waiting configuration using a spin lock. 
        See the methods do_busy_waiting() and stop_busy_waiting().</p>

    <p> Semaphore implementation was fixed to not call dec() inside a while.
        Every call to p() only decreases the _value once.
        The v() method was fixed to not call wakeup when it is not needed too. </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.inf.ufsc.br/~katcipis/SO2/exec2/mutex.h">Implementation of the Mutex Class.</a></p>

    <p> The implementation was tested with a Philosopher's Dinner, the only changes was a new Semaphore to 
        prevent race conditions when configuring and printing on the Display. There is a version of the same code
        but using Mutex too. </p>

    <strong>Thread fixes:</strong>
    
    <p> Fix(1) - The idle() method of the Thread was fixed, since the old
        implementation allowed a suspended thread to run. </p>

    <p> Fix(2) We added a _joinedLink to be used on the _joined Queue instead of sharing the _link
        of the _ready / _suspended Queues. </p>

    <p> Fix(3) The join method was not
        disabling interruptions, so there was a chance of a deadlock happening 
        (If the caller loses the CPU in the middle of the join() call and the
         callee Thread exits, when the caller Thread got the CPU back it would
         stay suspended forever). </p>
